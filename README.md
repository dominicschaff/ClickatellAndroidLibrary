ClickatellAndroidLibrary
========================

This is an Android Studio project.

Refer to the files for usage:

* app/src/main/java/com/schaff/clickatellsample/HttpActivity.java
* app/src/main/java/com/schaff/clickatellsample/RestActivity.java

Also remember to change your authentication details.

The library should be compatible with most version of android, I just used some views in the UI that needed a later version of Android.
